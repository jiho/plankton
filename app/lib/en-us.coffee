      '<h2>A few words about plankton</h2>'
      '<p>Plankton comes from the Greek word planktos which means “wanderer” or “drifter”.  As a group, plankton are an eclectic collection of diverse organisms adrift in the oceanic waters. The classification of an organism as ‘plankton’ is due to its inability to swim actively against oceanic currents rather than its biological grouping.</p>'
      '<p>Plankton can vary widely in size from thousandths of an inch (0.05 mm) or less to several feet in length (> 1m) or more, though a vast majority are less than an inch (~ 2.5 cm). Some organisms will spend all their life in the plankton and drift along with the ocean currents, while others are only temporary passive passengers until they reach a certain size and age, allowing for movement in the open ocean or settlement into a coastal habitat.</p>'
      '<p>There are two main types of plankton: phytoplankton (plants) and zooplankton (animals).</p>'
      '<p>We are most interested in the zooplankton because our underwater camera system is optimized to capture the image of larger planktonic organisms, ranging from a few mm to a few centimeters which includes a wide variety of different organisms.</p>'

      '<h2>Why study plankton?</h2>'
      '<p>Planktonic organisms are critically important food source to the all ocean.  Small phytoplankton form the beginning of the food supply which are consumed by larger plankton, then those plankton by larger organisms all the way up to fish and the largest species of whales found in the sea. No plankton: no life in the ocean.</p>'
      '<p>Plankton also play an important role in the global carbon cycle capturing the sun’s energy and the atmosphere’s CO2 at the surface of the ocean and releasing it, via the above food chain, to other organisms and other areas of the ocean from shallow coastal areas to the deep ocean basins.</p>'
      '<p>Understanding where and when plankton occur at different depths in the ocean allows scientists to get a global understanding of the function and health of the ocean from small to global scales.</p>'
      '<p>Plankton are also fascinating in their diversity of intricate and beautiful shapes. The weightlessness of life in the ocean environment allows for very delicate and complex body designs, which are almost impossible to keep intact with normal means of collection. Imaging systems provide a first glimpse of these amazing animals in their natural environment, and may even lead to discovery of new species.</p>'

      '<h2>How do we get the images?</h2>'
      '<p>Since the 1800’s, plankton has been studied and collected using simple nets with very fine mesh. The process of analysis of these plankton ‘samples’ is tedious, labor intensive, confined to laboratory, and can only be done on relatively small areas of the ocean. By sampling in this manner, it is difficult to get a good understanding of how planktonic organisms are distributed and how they interact with each other. Yet plankton represents a very important part of a global system feeding larger animals like fish, whales and many others. The In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System (ISIIS) is one of a few systems in the world capable of improving the way we study plankton to better understand their life and function in the marine environment. ISIIS is, in some ways, a “virtual net” which captures the images of the organisms and information about their immediate surroundings.  By sampling continuously, the result is a collection of digital images that record the exact location of the various plankton organisms in relation to each other and the environment in which they live. Further, the images are recorded onto a simple hard drive instead of slurry of plankton all mixed together in a sample jar with formaldehyde (yech!).</p>'
      '<p>ISIIS is an underwater imaging system developed to capture real time images of plankton that are relatively rare, small, and fragile such as fish larvae and delicate gelatinous organisms (like jelly fish). ISIIS is composed not only of a macro-camera system with its own illumination but it also is integrated into an underwater vehicle with a variety of additional sensors to measure the depth, salinity and temperature of the water, as well as such properties as dissolved oxygen, light level, and even how much chlorophyll a (measure of primary production) is present.   Together, the camera and sensors provide detailed profiles and tracks of what plankton are where and what the ocean environment around them is like.</p>'
      '<p>The vehicle, and associated imaging system and sensors, moves up and down through the water column using side-mounted, user-controlled dive fins (like an underwater glider) while being towed behind an oceanographic ship moving at 5 knots. The vehicle frame is divided into four compartmentalized enclosures with imaging and optical equipment seamlessly integrated into ISIIS’s ventral housings and environmental sensors and electronics in the dorsal housings. ISIIS is designed to undulate in a zigzag fashion between the surface and a maximum depth of 200 meters.</p>'
      '<p>The ISIIS system utilizes imaging technology very similar to an office scanner flipped on its side. The imaged parcel of water passes between the forward portions of two streamlined pods where it is “scanned” and transformed into a continuous image. The resulting very high-resolution image is of plankton in their natural position and orientation. When a sufficient volume of water is imaged this way, quantification of concentration (individuals per unit volume) and fine scale distribution is possible. ISIIS is capable of imaging a maximum of 162 Liters (43 gallons) of water per second (when moving at 5 knots) with a pixel resolution of 70 µm (the thickness of a human hair).</p>'
      '<p>The imaging data and associated oceanographic data are sent to the surface ship via a fiber optic cable and recorder onto a main computer for later viewing and analysis.</p>'
