      <h1>No plankton = No life in the ocean</h1>
      <p>Plankton also play an important role in the global carbon cycle. This cycle captures the Sun’s energy and the atmosphere’s CO2 at the surface of the ocean and releases it to other organisms and other areas of the ocean.</p>
      <p>Understanding where and when plankton occur at different depths in the ocean allows scientists to get a global understanding of the function and health of the ocean from small to global scales.</p>

      lobate: '''
        Round to oval, with bristled (comb) rows along the major axis – though rows not apparent in some species. Certain species look balloon-shaped with two small, opposing lobes. Others may have large lobes visible on the “bottom” of the organism. Range in size from small to extra large.  Typically appears opaque in images.
      '''

      larvaceanHouse: '''
        A striped blob-like ‘web’ usually surrounding a tadpole-like inhabitant, appearing like a child’s slinky.  Can be very transparent but appears darker, or more ‘splotchy,’ as debris is collected.
      '''

      salp: '''
        Cocoon shaped with the interior appearing like a basket weave.  Not always symmetrical but usually has a distinct ovular shape.  Transparent with dark features lining the interior of the organism.
      '''

      thalasso: '''
        Typically cap or dome-like, but when feeding, appears more spherical or inflated.  Transparent with distinct, ornamental lines apparent on surface (jagged lines running on the outside of the body).  The dome-like shape of the organism may be seen as a conjoined hood of two expanded lobes.
      '''

      doliolidWithoutTail: '''
        Barrel shaped body with interior striations along the minor axis, appearing similar to a pineapple in certain orientations.  May or may not have a tail.
      '''

      rocketThimble: '''
        Thimble-shaped with a single, long, branching “tail”.
      '''

      rocketTriangle: '''
        Similar overall shape to rocketship thimble but with an arrow-head body. Typically observed with a simple “tail” but sometimes displaying an elaborate array of branching tentacles.
      '''

      siphoCornCob: '''
        A very diverse group identifiable by an aggregation of gas filled chambers, appearing somewhat like a corn cob.  “Tail” ranges from simple, thin tentacles to an elaborate feature, with chambers similar to the body and often branching tentacles.
      '''

      siphoTwoCups: '''
        Hooded organism with a multi-chambered stem with trailing tentacles attached.  Characteristic hood composed of two adjoined cups. “Tail” is broad and elaborate, with dark interior features.
      '''

      doliolidWithTail: '''
        Barrel shaped body with interior striations along the minor axis, appearing similar to a pineapple in certain orientations.  May or may not have a tail.
      '''

        Acorn or (American) football shaped with bands along the major axis that are sometimes observed with fine, hair-like combs.  Possess two trailing tentacles with varying degrees of branching.
      '''

      solmaris: '''
        Jellyfish with flat head. It has many distinct tentacles (16-40). Tentacles look like long eyelashes: compared to other jellyfish, they appear stiffer, shorter and more uniformly oriented. Solmaris often occurs with multiple individuals contained in a single frame.
      '''

      medusaFourTentacles: '''
        Typical jellyfish body with a dangling, central finger-like structure coming out of the bell.  It has four long, thin tentacles.

    about:
      title: 'About plankton'
      content: '''
        <h1>A few words about plankton</h1>
        <p><img src="./images/copepod.jpg" class="framed left" /></p>
        <p>Plankton comes from the Greek word planktos meaning “wanderer” or “drifter”. As a group, plankton are an eclectic collection of organisms adrift in the oceanic waters. The classification of an organism as ‘plankton’ has nothing to do with its biological grouping, but rather with its inability to swim actively against oceanic currents.</p>
        <p><img src="./images/DSCN7015.jpg" class="framed right" /></p>
        <p>Plankton vary widely in size from thousandths of an inch (0.05 mm) or less to several feet in length (> 1m) or more. Most are less than an inch (~ 2.5 cm). Some organisms spend all their life as plankton and drift along with the ocean currents, while others are only temporary passive passengers until they reach a certain size and age, allowing for movement in the open ocean or settlement into a coastal habitat.</p>
        <p>There are two main types of plankton: phytoplankton (plants) and zooplankton (animals). We are most interested in the zooplankton because our underwater camera system is optimized to capture the image of larger planktonic organisms, ranging from a few mm to a few centimeters which includes a wide variety of different organisms.</p>
      '''

    whyStudy:
      title: 'Why study plankton?'
      content: '''
        <h1>Why study plankton?</h1>
        <p>Planktonic organisms are critically important food source to the all ocean.  Small phytoplankton form the beginning of the food supply which are consumed by larger plankton, then those plankton by larger organisms all the way up to fish and the largest species of whales found in the sea. No plankton: no life in the ocean.</p>
        <p>Plankton also play an important role in the global carbon cycle capturing the sun’s energy and the atmosphere’s CO2 at the surface of the ocean and releasing it, via the above food chain, to other organisms and other areas of the ocean from shallow coastal areas to the deep ocean basins.</p>
        <p>Understanding where and when plankton occur at different depths in the ocean allows scientists to get a global understanding of the function and health of the ocean from small to global scales.</p>
        <p>Plankton are also fascinating in their diversity of intricate and beautiful shapes. The weightlessness of life in the ocean environment allows for very delicate and complex body designs, which are almost impossible to keep intact with normal means of collection. Imaging systems provide a first glimpse of these amazing animals in their natural environment, and may even lead to discovery of new species.</p>
      '''

    images:
      title: 'How do we get the images?'
      content: '''
        <h1>How do we get the images?</h1>
        <p><img src="./images/isiis.jpg" class="framed left" /></p>
        <p>The In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System (ISIIS) is one of a few systems in the world capable of improving the way we study plankton to better understand their life and function in the marine environment. ISIIS is, in some ways, a “virtual net” which captures the images of the organisms and information about their immediate surroundings. By sampling continuously, the result is a collection of digital images that record the exact location of the various plankton organisms in relation to each other and the environment in which they live. Further, the images are recorded onto a simple hard drive instead of slurry of plankton all mixed together in a sample jar with formaldehyde (yech!).</p
        <p>ISIIS is composed of a macro-camera system with its own illumination and is integrated into an underwater vehicle with a variety of additional sensors to measure the depth, salinity and temperature of the water, as well as such properties as dissolved oxygen, light level, and even how much chlorophyll a (measure of primary production) is present. Together, the camera and sensors provide detailed profiles and tracks of what plankton are where and what the ocean environment around them is like.

      <h2>Education</h2>

      <h3>Can I use #{PROJECT_NAME} in the classroom?</h3>
      <p>Of course! #{PROJECT_NAME}, just like all the <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/">Zooniverse</a> projects, offers students a unique opportunity to explore real scientific data, while making a contribution to cutting-edge research. Each image is marked by multiple volunteers, so it’s okay if students don't identify and mark all of the plankton correctly. That being said, the task itself is simple enough that we believe most people can take part and make a worthwhile contribution regardless of age.</p>

      <h3>What resources are there to support use in the classroom?</h3>
      <p>Videos are a great tool to introduce students to the fascinating, diverse, and sometimes bizarre undersea world of plankton. Here are a couple of our favorites.</p>
